                      <p>
                      Keeping up with the Cordova project, I rant about the good, and the bad of Framework7 while looking at some of the problems I 
                      encountered along the way. A lot of notes on how I would like documentation to be done.
                      </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                    <B><big>The very first </big></B>thing I complained about React Native was a lack of available UI components. I did find NativeBase, which seems to 
                    be furthest along, but I have to say that it’s a long way from reaching what <a target="_blank" href="https://framework7.io/">Framework7</a> has. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Framework7 is already into the development of a second version, the one which I am currently using, and it by far surpasses any other free alternatives. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When you visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova Homepage,</a> 
                    if you scroll down a bit you will find the Cordova Tools section. This section is a bit misleading as to what it 
                    actually is linking to. Tools like PhoneGap and Ionic are actual forks for Cordova, that provide their own plugins sometimes and offer cloud-hosting 
                    services such as CodePush or Graphical Developer Studios that make setting up a Cordova Application easier than it already is, however I see them as 
                    orientated more towards people that don’t actually want to deal with the actual effort of making an application from scratch. They are kind of like 
                    the WordPress for mobile apps, which is not a bad thing except for the fact that they are always looking for ways to get subscriptions, either by locking 
                    features or other tactics. Now, as I pointed out in my CodePush post, it’s not a bad thing, but be aware of where it all leads to. For me I feel much more 
                    confident in Microsoft’s platform than Adobe’s or the others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    However, the real point I want to make is that Framework7 is not like these other tools. It’s actually just an open source collection of Javascript 
                    and CSS that can turn any HTML file into a single page application. The entire thing is on GitHub, it has an active community and forum, even a core 
                    team that seems to be pushing fixes weekly. Now for those of you screaming your lungs out: “It’s another god damn ******* framework like Angular or 
                    React” You are on the right track, and hear me out, I’m with you, but it’s really not the same. Framework7 provides an IOS/Material design overlay 
                    for native Javascript. The project is much more CSS than Javascript. THERE IS JAVASCRIPT, don’t get me wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    They implemented Dom7, which is essentially just a simple base fork of jQuery that uses $$ instead of $ for the same core team.  But overall, it’s more about bringing 
                    IOS/Material Design elements than it is about adding a detailed API like Angular for example. That said, you might actually want a detailed Javascript API, and 
                    if that’s the case you are in luck. For V2, Framework7 can be integrated with <a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> to really make a complex application. So far I’ve stuck to Dom7 and jQuery 
                    (for some added functions) thus I can’t go into detail about Vue.js, but from the surface it looks like making the transition would be easy enough and beneficial 
                    when the need arises.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Additionally, I need to address something that I might not have made clear previously. Cordova is really just a glorified wrapped browser, that gives access to some 
                    Javascript API and the ability to add native plugins. The real Cordova is the CLI, which is used by <a target="_blank" href="https://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a>. So no matter what, you are building a 
                    Single Page Application with some framework, or using the native Javascript API, or at the ver least just displaying a static HTML file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Other things that I enjoy about Framework7 is that the documentation is very extensive. The docs they provided go to great lengths to provide multiple examples 
                    of how to use the available components. This plus the fact that it’s free and easy to setup makes it a great start for someone like myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Nonetheless, as in my introduction to Cordova, the strength is the weakness. Making your own custom elements is really easy because it just requires you to know 
                    how to use CSS, but CSS is also the issue, especially isolating it. This is also the point where the vast documentation that made me so happy at the start falls 
                    through as just a pretty paper-wall. There is very little in-dept documentation for the Javascript API and the CSS. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    First, the Javascript API is a mix of missing documentation for settings such as DomCache or the Dom7 API. Even if Dom7 is supposed to be jQuery, there is differences, 
                    which made me eventually have to add jQuery to my project and continuously scour the GitHub repository reading the actual files to see what is going on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Secondly, the CSS has also forced me to look into the repo to see what CSS is being applied where. Inheritance is the real issue for this one. Without 
                    ShadowDOM being in every browser, there is not much Framework7 can do. So far my only solution is using the !important hack to override certain elements. 
                    The other thing that bugs me is that Framework7 seems to not be utilizing everything available to them. Simple FlexBox elements can be added to improve the 
                    browser client experience, as having info cards span a 1920px screen is broken beyond words. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    All of this is before I even reached actual bugs Framework7 has. The best example of something like this is that I was trying to get a video.js player to overlay 
                    the video tags, just like in a normal browser. However, when this player would go into full screen mode, there would be a slight offset that would expose the default 
                    login page or popup page underneath. This could be scrolled into. The offset was produced by the Status Bar which I was able to fix, however the scroll thing I could 
                    not. This was an obvious bug as if you switched to the IOS CSS it could not be reproduced after the Status Bar fix. But Material Design was forever broken.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I spent a good chunk of time trying different players, all of which had this issue apart from the regular HTML5 video player. The only explanation I can gather is that 
                    because the login page and pop up page are present in the index.html when the application starts, the full screen request by any Javascript player get’s limited to 
                    going full screen in the “view” div tag that Framework7 uses to simulate multiple pages within a single page application. No matter where you put the HTML of the login 
                    page or popup it would forever be scrollable into view in the Material Design. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    My solution was to remove them and add them dynamically when needed, which is perfectly fine, but having them in the index.html was how the documentation was setup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This brings me into my final gripe. They show too many ways of doing the something. Some are way better than others, but those details are not covered. Again, 
                    the only solution is to read through the raw code on GitHub or post a question to their forum where you may or may not get an answer. And, I forgot to mention 
                    that V1 documentation is still floating around as are questions and answers that will mislead you greatly unless you are really paying attention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Finishing off this rant, I’d like to point out that I am happy that Framework7 is free and really easy for making the simple things. I would love if others had 
                    as many examples as Framework7 has in it’s documentation as I found it to be the quickest way to see how things work. The interactive demos are a great bonus 
                    and I truly wish other places would put this amount of effort into their docs. The detailed and more in-dept information will come with time, and when they realize 
                    they need to update the docs when they answer a question about ambiguous functions or elements we might be getting somewhere. I personally wish Dom7 was just jQuery 
                    from the get go, a lot less hassle as you can just send people to the jQuery docs and be done with it. The CSS issue seems like it will forever loom over this team 
                    until browser can all offer something like ShadowDOM or they find a really nice way of isolating the CSS on their own. I wish to see some focus sent towards some 
                    browser / Win10 app components just so that I don’t have one list span my entire screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    All of this said, I’m working out the kinks day by day and hopefully I can share some code snippets soon to give some examples of how to avoid all the stupid little 
                    troubles that I had to deal with.
