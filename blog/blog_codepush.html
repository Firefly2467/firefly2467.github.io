                      <p>
                      Continuing on my previous Cordova Intro, I note some of the available options for rapid code release and give my thoughts on why 
                      CodePush was a GREAT addition to my little programming project.
                      </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                    <B><big>I am </big></B>going to try to write this post as less of a story and more of just a collection of thoughts. 
                    In the previous post I gushed over being able to quickly debug code in browser with a Dev Console. And while that is a super cool feature, 
                    what isn’t is compiling the native app packages, in my case the APK for the most part. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Going through that process is long, especially after you have made a large change. Gradle likes to tell you that it will get progressively faster, 
                    and that it’s only slow because it’s the first time you are compiling, but the fact of the matter is after maybe 50 revisions, Gradle keeps telling 
                    me it’s the first time. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This however is no place to bring back my Gradle troubles, so instead I’m going to blame Cordova on this one, but either way it’s slow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The second thing that became apparent to me is that the only reason I have 50 revisions in a day is because I’m not the best coder. 
                    This is not a problem any normal person would have, or maybe care. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Another thing that came into my mind while looking through my old phone was that I stopped automatic updates for the Play Store. The reason 
                    I did this was because every time an app would auto-update, my phone would get slower or just out right crash multiple times. I am a firm believer 
                    of the “forced-obsolescence” conspiracy (Which isn’t a conspiracy anymore, after Apple <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/28/apple-apologizes-for-not-being-clearer-about-slowing-down-iphones-with-older-batteries/">admitted to slowing</a> 
                    older IOS devices?). Either way the Play Store sucks in my opinion for keeping your users on the most up to date version of your app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The initial thought in my head was that I could load parts of my app from a webserver, which I later confirmed was indeed the case. However, 
                    if you did this your app would be useless without an internet connection. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Searching around I did indeed find a so-called “hydration” plugin for Cordova that would allow for rewriting of the local WebApp when an internet connection is available. 
                    However, as the case seems to be ever so popular, the plugin was a community plugin that didn’t have great documentation or support and the biggest issue was 
                    that it looked <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-hot-code-push">abandoned</a> with many issues unresolved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Either way I’m proud to say that I got it working, sadly it’s not for the “man on no budget” projects, such as was my endeavor. This plugin required you to run 
                    your own fileserver. I was able to get it working from pulling the files it needed from a git repository and kept the files in sync by pushing a commit every time I 
                    wanted to push an update. It worked, and one day it just stopped. From what I could gather it seemed like the git part was fine but the manifest that was keeping track 
                    of the changes had bugs that eventually resulted in a state where the app could only be updated by reinstalling the APK (Maybe a JS error that kills all other functions). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Don’t get me wrong, I have a feeling people still use it, but my assumption is that most have moved on to CodePush. First thing first, CodePush made a plugin for 
                    Cordova. It has a very detailed and usefull API. It makes your update system work the way you want it to (Update on user action, on prompt, ect.) which means that 
                    the whole interaction between you and your users can be civil, not just an auto update at app launch like the previous plugin was like. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Secondly, the hosting is free. Or kinda, depends on how you look at it. Microsoft acquired/supports <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push">
                    CodePush</a> and the system became part of the Microsoft Visual Studio App Center, 
                    and your hosting is provided by Azure. All that is needed in to register an account, or just use a Google account, and you get access to a lot of tools.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I’d like to make a separate post on the tools because I have only recently been looking into them, but Microsoft’s goal in all of this is to make money once 
                    your application becomes more official and business like. Analytics tools and Crash report tools all work up to a limit, after which they want you to sign up for a
                    paid service. However, as long as you don’t see yourself ever needing advanced support, or at the very least you have a plan on how to monetize your application, 
                    I don’t see anything on the horizon that could be any better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    And CodePush isn’t just for Cordova, they have a React Native plugin too. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The only other things I would like to address on this topic is the quirks related to the different standards that the individual platforms set for hydration and 
                    the point I want to make is related to issues it has with Cordova.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The quirks come down to this: hydration/codepush is OK per the Play Store and App Store Guidelines. 
                    Check for any specific rules that need to be followed in relation to this setup. As of writing this I know that Apple does not 
                    want your app to actively prompt the user with a dialog to update the app. My understanding is that it’s similar to the banned action of asking users 
                    to install other apps. Either way, make sure you look around and know what you can and can’t do with your app on different platforms. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Lastly, if you are not careful you can permanently disable the CodePush feature if you push code that is broken. In Cordova, if you mess up 
                    anything Javascript related, your app will load to a white screen. It’s always good practice to check in the browser before pushing the code with that 
                    simple CLI command. The API given by CodePush is for the Javascript part of your app and if you push a broken update it will take the new update, apply it 
                    and then the user won’t be able to update again unless they reinstall the application. However, because Javascript is a weird language, don’t bank on seeing a 
                    white screen to tell you that the code has an error. Best practice is to check before pushing and if possible adding a fallback manual update. CodePush has the 
                    API for this to be a non issue, but it’s down to the programmer to actually implement it in a useful matter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In summary, CodePush has been great for fixing platform specific bugs quickly for me. With all the tools that are offered, including the fact that you can 
                    have different branches (say one for development and another for public release), CodePush seems to me as a no brainer for any kind of project.
                    </p>
