                      I take a look at Apache Cordova and its variations, pointing to its strengths and weaknesses while telling my tale of wall jumping antic’s.

                    <big>Well</big> let me set the stage for my next set of adventures. Let’s say I metaphorically ran myself into a wall. Well apart from the normal consequences that come with one jumping into a nice sturdy brick wall, I was left with a good amount of “free” time.  
                    I of course had some other things I had to take care of, but overall my life after jumping into the imaginary wall was calmer then what my life had been like before.  Nonetheless, this isn’t about walls. Or maybe it is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    With the time I hade at my disposal I looked to occupy it with something useful, and I had previously racked up a list of personal problems that I would try to fix. One of these “pain points” of mine was shared by many others in my online communities. 
                    I needed to improve mobile access to several sites and services, for myself, but for others as well. The solution is clear:
                        <blockquote>
                          <p>
                          “What device do you have?”
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          An old Android phone from 2012.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          “So get the Android Studio and make a native app!”
                          </p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Now that seems like the smart choice, however there is two points I need to add to explain why I didn’t make the smart decision. 
                    First, I have no idea if it’s me or Gradle, the build tool Android Studio uses (It’s probably me…) https://stackoverflow.com/a/24828666  but I have 
                    never had a good experience with it and the Android Studio. I never spent the time to figure out how to get it running without it spewing millions 
                    of unreadable errors with no fix. For the simplest of things, I found myself battling error after error, some due to my client 
                    (My linux installed on the usb, usually poor non-mac linux support for the studio) or due to file structure problems when trying to edit sample applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Either way, the less whinny reason is that even if the main target was myself, I knew others would also benefit from my core concept, and even if I got Android Studio working, 
                    I would have the same setup problems with IOS and anything else.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    With that last thought, I set off to find something I had never known existed. The first thing that came to mind was “a multi-platform application”. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Right away, through my friends, I was introduced to React and React Native. Facebook’s answer to my curiosity on how to reach all the platforms. 
                    However, I don’t jump without looking first (Forget about the wall thing OK?). I can write an entire blog on my short-lived adventure with React Native, 
                    but to sum it up: On paper it looks good, in reality it doesn’t quite meet its goal, at least not yet. It’s still missing a lot of native interaction functions, 
                    to deal with a devices camera for example, and lacked the tools necessary to quickly test the application (Expo, I hear you shout. Again, good on paper, useless when 
                    it comes to actually testing) and even produce decent UI, or at the very least components to help keep with the IOS or Material design guidelines (Important for when 
                    you actually want to get your application approved). I would like to point out that many people have had great success with React Native and the UI thing is a less of 
                    a problem for people who have actually committed to a project. Even so, an important thing to note no matter who you are or what you want to do, it’s important to note 
                    that apart from IOS and Android, the other platform options are limited and not well documented. This also applies to others such as Electron that don’t currently have a 
                    clear path to the mobile sector.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    However, my situation is different. I’m a solo coder (not a great one at that), and I’m working on a niche application idea with no resources. 
                    Not to mention that even if I have a slight idea what I am doing when it comes to UI’s, I am in no way interested in wasting time writing a UI from scratch 
                    (Especially with Javascript) when the main goal is content aggregation. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    And thus, my search became more refined: I needed something multi-platform, that offered device component support 
                    (filesystem, camera, sensors) and offered some easy to start but also highly customizable UI, for the eventual moment when I want to move away from the default.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    That’s when I stumbled on “hybrid-apps” and more specifically, I met Cordova. I’m going to link to the Wikipedia page for Cordova and their main page if you want to 
                    understand in detail it’s journey. The short and sweet version goes a little like this in my opinion: Cordova Apache is a wrapper for HTML5 WebApps that supports Android, 
                    IOS, Windows mobile apps/ Win10 apps, Blackberry (OK?) and of course most modern browsers (Because you are technically making a WebApp).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Cordova really caught my eye with this nice summary. Cordova offers many plugins that can expose different device components to the WebApp. Search around a 
                    little and you can find HTML/CSS/JS Frameworks that can give you that default Material and IOS design but can also be highly customized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Yet, it’s not all sunshine. I would like to bring up a very key point when it comes to making anything: There will ALWAYS be problems. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For Cordova over the past couple of weeks it comes down to some big issues, but at least for me they were manageable, and that is why I feel it’s important to 
                    clarify that I in no way am trying to convince anyone of anything regarding what they should or shouldn’t use for their own projects. All I am trying to do is 
                    document the steps I took to find what best suited me and my own goal, and hopefully help people that are starting off what to watch out for when they begin their own journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    After finding Cordova and jumping in I found myself really happy with the CLI provided. You can use graphical interfaces by other companies, but the Cordova 
                    CLI is easy to use and completely free. Adding different platform support is only a command away, and after manually installing the separate dev tools such as the 
                    Android Studio for example, everything lines up nice for a simple one liner to compile for Android, IOS, Win10 APP or the others. You can also add the “browser” 
                    platform that lets you open the application in the browser of your choice, which is extremely fast and with Chrome or Firefox Dev Console it is super easy to debug 
                    code event before compiling for a platform. I will cover the framework I am using for the UI in another post. Long story short, the first couple of weeks was  
                    great for the applications progress. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Browserifying some node packages gave me great control over the core of my application and the official plugins provided by the Cordova project made sure I had access 
                    to store files on the device, take pictures, control the Splashscreen, the Statusbar and the Battery Status.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Sadly, the problems I faced came directly from what made Cordova so appealing. HTML 5 is supposed to be a living standard, which for me only equates into things working well 
                    in Firefox, breaking in Chrome or wanting to isolate CSS and finding out that Firefox still lacks ShadowDOM and other features that work great in Chrome. Don’t even get 
                    me started for Edge / Internet Explorer! And browsers differences aren’t the end…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Cordova opts to use the built-in web viewers in Android and IOS. On the IOS side it’s not as bad (from what I have seen) but for Android it’s a mess. The quick rundown is 
                    that up to 4.0 Ice-cream Sandwich, all previous versions shipped with a different versions of WebView, in till it finally switched to a Chrome/Blink based Viewer that 
                    “theoretically” gets updated across all Android versions after 4.0 . The even quicker rundown on CrossWalk if you have heard of it is that it was terminated in 2017.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    What I would have liked to see is a unified browser that shipped inside of the APK or IPA so that no matter what platform you are on you know the experience will be 
                    the same, this is harder on the Cordova Team but would make developing for multiple platforms easier. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The second issue is with the plugins. They are limited. With so many devices to support, building plugins that expose native functions becomes extremely difficult. 
                    And when I say devices, I mean devices not platform. Individual bugs with a certain type of phone is a high occurrence. The silver lining is that many community plugins 
                    exist for some of these quirks, but this is the real point where your mileage may vary. It worked out for me, but it won’t for all. The best example is the entire maze 
                    you need to pass to get your app to snap a picture on Android. Android might kill your application to save on resources while your application is in the background when 
                    taking the picture from the camera application. And even if that is not a problem, your application still needs to listen for when it comes back into view to receive the 
                    image that was taking. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not impossible but a lot of wasted time for something that should be fairly straight forward.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                      The fact is your access to the devices resources are much more limited than if you were building a native app.      
                      </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                    The inconsistencies on the different platforms, the difficulty of utilizing a devices resources are not things that can be easily described, but for me at least 
                    the frustration was real, and still is. However, the real point I want to make with this short story is that nothing will go your way when you want it. For all the 
                    strengths I found in my “perfect” solution, they were also my biggest enemies, and more than that they made me doubt the direction I was going. More than anything else 
                    I regret wasting time getting discouraged and out right abandoning Cordova to go see if React Native would be easier. No joke, I started a React Native project folder 4 
                    times in a span of roughly a month every time I hit a wall in Cordova. And guess what, it wasn’t going to be easier. React Native has it’s own problems. Some of them are 
                    even shared with Cordova.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    That said, I write these things primarily for myself and anyone else reading this can interpret it however they would like. But my message to myself for when I start another project is this:<br>
                    Know what you want. Know what you need. Know the weakness of your strength. Pick your poison and stick with it till the very end. Oh, and don’t go jumping into imaginary walls anymore. 
                    And stay clear of jumping into actual walls if that isn’t clear for you in the future.

                      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The European languages are members of the same family.</li>
                      <li>Their separate existence is a myth.</li>
                      <li>For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words.</p>
